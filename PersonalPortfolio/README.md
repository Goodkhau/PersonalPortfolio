The goal with this app is:
    1. An interactive webpage showcasing my frontend skills
    2. Components containing information about myself and my various projects.
    3. Relatively simplistic in color but still pleasing to look at.

Steps for a great portfolio.
    1. Homepage should be a small description with project list.
    2. There should be a contact page.
    3. About me page.
    4. There should also be a skills and experience tab showcasing languages and work in the field.
